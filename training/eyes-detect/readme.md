# Train the YOLOv8 Model

You can train the YOLOv8 model on any machine with the required environment. For detailed usage and steps, refer to the official Ultralytics documentation:

- [Training YOLOv8 Documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/#usage-examples)

---

# Export the Model to TensorRT

After training the model, export it to TensorRT for optimized deployment on NVIDIA Jetson devices.

- [Export to TensorRT Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/nvidia-jetson/#use-tensorrt-on-nvidia-jetson)  

 **Note:** You must export the model on the device where you plan to run the TensorRT model for deployment.
